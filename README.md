## Known Issues

1. This website was made for desktop sizes only, and is expected to only be appropriately spaced and laid out on desktop-sized browsers.
2. There is an existing issue when creating an outfit where the images don't load. This is a visual bug in the website and using the horizontal arrows to paginate away and back will fix its appearance.
